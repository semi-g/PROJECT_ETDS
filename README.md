# PROJECT_ETDS
Enhanced Threat Detection System is a test project that uses object detection to detect dangerous objects and alert users.

*Stage 1: Create and test simple Object Detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks

*Stage 2: Retrain the model -> use transfer learning to add personal layer to an advanced OD model.
This layer should be trained to recognize items that can be considered a threat (knives, guns, etc.)

*Stage 3: Convert the model to a Real-time Object Detection system compatible with and optimized for Raspberry Pi
